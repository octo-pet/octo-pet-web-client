# About

Octo-Pet is an initiative created so I could learn how to use different technologies in a real-world project.

Special thanks to awesome open source projects which made this project possible:

- Frontend Toolkit by [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Icons by [Angular FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/angular)
- Material Dashboard by [Creative Tim](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/material-dashboard)
- Material UI Kit by [Creative Tim](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/material-kit)
- Images, backgrounds and logos by [DALL-E 2](https://labs.openai.com/)
